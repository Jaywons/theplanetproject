  <h1 style="color:green">What is causing our pollution today?</h1>
  <h1>-----------------------------------------------</h1>
  <h3 style="color:green">Sulfur Oxides and Nitrogen Oxides</h3>
  <p style="color:green">Reducing the amount of electricity you use can help reduce pollutants and the resulting acid rain. Americans are dependent on electricity, and most electricity in this country is produced at power plants that burn coal. Power plants are the largest source of sulfur dioxide and a significant source of nitrogen oxide, which are components of acid rain. Solar, wind and hydro-electric power are alternatives to the polluting methods used to produce electricity. Because they do not burn fuels to produce energy, they do not produce any measurable amounts of pollution.
</p>
<h3 style="color:green">Carbon Monoxide and Nitrogen Oxides</h3>
<p style="color:green">Consider public transportation and carpooling to help reduce two major pollutants. Vehicles are the largest producers of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide, which are two criteria pollutants (see References 3). Carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen available to breathe. It is odorless and colorless, making it very dangerous to humans (see References 4). Nitrogen oxide is a component of ground-level ozone, which is responsible for many respiratory illnesses, especially in children, the elderly and people with diseases of the lungs</p>
